          Education plays a vital role in shaping successful people. It gives us
          the opportunity to become a productive member of a civilized society
          by acquiring all the necessary skills. We learn how to meet challenges
          and overcome obstacles. We learn how to become an integrated
          personality and maintain the perpetuation of our culture. People learn
          basic norms, rules, regulations, and values of society through
          education. Moreover, high quality education enables us to lead a
          successful life, enhances our intelligence, skills, knowledge, and
          brings positive changes in our life. Education lays the foundation
          stone for our future. An illiterate person can find it very difficult
          to cope with some aspects of life. Education expands our vision and
          creates awareness.

          Modern education is liberal, open, and exoteric. It is the premise of
          progress, in every family and in every society. It teaches people to
          reason. It is based on the humanism, freedom, equality, democracy, and
          human rights. The content of education keeps pace with the needs of
          modern society and is a mirror of its goals, values, and priorities.
          The present industrial society has opened up a plenty of occupations
          which require people with specialized skills and knowledge. So,
          education is a necessary means of eradicating the unemployment
          problem. It is able to reduce poverty in a number of ways. But we have
          to remember that there is a great need for the growth of the
          vocational education so that every person could pursue a fulfilling
          career that ensures a satisfied life.
